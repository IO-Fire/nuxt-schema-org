## ⚠️ Breaking Changes

### Module Site Config Removed

The `siteUrl` and `siteName` have been removed from the module options.

Configuration has been moved to [Site Config](/site-config).

```ts [nuxt.config]
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  site: {
    url: 'https://example.com',
    name: 'My Website',
  }
})
```
