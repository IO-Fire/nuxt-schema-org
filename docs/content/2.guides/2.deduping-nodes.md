## Deduplicating a node

When generating many of the Schema.org nodes a default global `@id` is used to help with best practices. 

For example:

```ts
useSchemaOrg([
  defineOrganization() // generates the nodes with an #identity id
])
```

This allows the node relations to be automatically mapped for best practices.

```ts
useSchemaOrg([
  defineWebPage() // knows to link the #identity id
])
```

However, it can get in the way of
configuring multiple nodes of the same type. To get around this you should provide your own `@id` on the node:

```ts
useSchemaOrg([
  defineOrganization({
    '@id': '#some-company'
  })
])
```

## Replacing a node

It is not possible to replace a node using `useSchemaOrg` as data will be merged by default. A node will only be removed 
from the graph once the `useSchemaOrg` scope is disposed.

```ts
useSchemaOrg([
  defineOrganization({
    '@id': '#some-company',
    name: 'My Company'
  }),
])

useSchemaOrg([
  defineOrganization({
    '@id': '#some-company',
    url: 'https://example.com'
  })
])

// Merged!
// {
//   '@id': '#some-company',
//   name: 'My Company',
//   url: 'https://example.com'
// }
```

If you're having issues working around the default nodes, you should disable them.

```ts [nuxt.config.ts]
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  schemaOrg: {
    defaults: false
  }
})
```
