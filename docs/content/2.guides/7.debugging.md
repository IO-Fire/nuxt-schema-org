It's recommended test your Schema.org output whenever your deploying any Schema.org updates.

To do so, you can make use of the debugging features.

## Nuxt DevTools

The best tool for debugging is the Nuxt DevTools integration with Nuxt Schema.org.

This will give you your Schema.org graph and handy links to test it.

This is enabled by default in development, simply navigate to the Schema.org tab.

## Debug Endpoint

A debug endpoint is available when `debug` is on at `/__schema-org__/debug.json`. This provides
basic runtime data used to generate the Schema.org graph.

## External Debugging Tools

You can test your Schema.org using the following tools:
- [Google Rich Results Test](https://search.google.com/test/rich-results)
- [Schema.org Validator](https://validator.schema.org/)
