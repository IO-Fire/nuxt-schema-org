title: Setup Identity
description: Set up Schema.org on your Nuxt app quickly.
---

By default, a Nuxt plugin is registered in your app that will register the root nodes for a
`WebSite` and `WebPage` for you.

These are configured using [Nuxt Site Config](/site-config/getting-started/how-it-works),

The only configuration you may need to provide is the identity of your site.

## Selecting An Identity

Beforehand you'll need to decide on what type of identity you want to use.

You can use either [Organisation](https://unhead.unjs.io/schema-org/recipes/identity#organization) or [Person](https://unhead.unjs.io/schema-org/recipes/identity#person), learn
more about their differences on the [Choosing an identity](https://unhead.unjs.io/schema-org/recipes/identity) docs.

## Setup

The simplest way to set up your identity is to set it in your `nuxt.config` using a string:

```ts [nuxt.config.ts]
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  schemaOrg: {
    identity: 'Organization' // or 'Person'
  }
})
```

For more complex configurations, you can provide an object with the `type`:

```ts [nuxt.config.ts]
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  schemaOrg: {
    identity: {
      type: 'Organization',
      name: 'My Company',
      url: 'https://example.com',
      logo: 'https://example.com/logo.png'
    }
  }
})
```
