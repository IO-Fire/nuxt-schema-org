## Introduction

**Type:** `function useSchemaOrg(nodes: SchemaOrgNode[]): ActiveHeadEntry`{lang="ts"}

Insert Schema.org structured data into your page.

In development mode your Schema.org will be reactive, but once you deploy you'll notice that it's static.

This is because the composable only works in a server-side context by default outside of development for performance reasons.
You'll need to use enable the [reactive](/docs/schema-org/api/config#reactive) module configuration if you'd like to use this client-side.

## Usage

```ts
import { useSchemaOrg } from '#imports'

useSchemaOrg([
  defineWebPage({
    name: 'Hello World'
  })
])
```
